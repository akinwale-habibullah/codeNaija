# Interested in hacking with the best Nigerian devlopers?

CodeNaija is a Nigerian Hackathon hosted by GitHub's Employee Resource Group, the [Blacktocats](https://twitter.com/blacktocats). Our goal for the hackathon is to highlight the existing community of Nigerian developers by showcasing their amazing talent and work. 

We will do this by incorporating Black talent from the US to aid and assist. We can build a bridge which not only promotes networking from a talent perspective, but we'll also have the ability to share knowledge and strengthen Black People in Tech as a whole. 

Due to the limited space, we are asking all potential particpants to complete a questionnaire to reserve a place in the hackathon.
