CodeNaija is Nigerian Hackathon host by the GitHub's Employee resource Group, the [Blacktocats](https://twitter.com/blacktocats). Our goal for the hackathon is to highlight the existing community of Nigerian developers by showcasing their amazing talent and work. We will do this by incorporating Black talent in the US to aid and assist, we can build a bridge which not only promotes networking from a talent perspective, but we also have the ability to share knowledge and strengthen Black People in Tech as a whole. Which of course, is, the fundamental goal overall. By going on this endeavor we hope to affect the following:

- Help create a pipeline of Black Talent from Nigeria
- Showcase booming talent, ideas and products from Nigeria
- Sync local Nigerians with possible investors/ceo's/business owners who can help bring their ideas to market
- Bring GitHub to a large Developer community, gaining access to another market of opportunity.
